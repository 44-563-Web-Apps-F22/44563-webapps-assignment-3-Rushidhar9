    <h3>VIKRAM</h3>
    <p>
        Vikram is a Tamil action, thriller movie, written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj.
        Kamal Haasan reportedly plays a retired cop in Vikram, and he will be seen in full-on action mode.
        Kamal Haasan will also be seen doing high-octane action sequences in the film.The popular composer Anirudh
        Ravichander has given the best for the film as songs have been receiving great responses, and
        he is expected to carry the same with the film's background score.
